# MATLAB_code_sample
This code is a MATLAB function (called Fx_N.m) that, given optimization variables (oil well controls) and a number of parameters related to a particular oil-production optimization problem, computes the corresponding cost function (discounted net present value associated with oil production). The cost function computation requires the running of an external reservoir-flow simulation and consequently the generation of the input files for the simulator based on the optimization variables, and the reading of the simulator output needed in the computation of the cost function. Additional intermediate computations associated with the cost function are also provided as output in this MATLAB function.
